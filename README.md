# Volume Hand Tracking

This project demonstrates hand tracking capabilities using OpenCV and MediaPipe in Python. It leverages MediaPipe's powerful machine learning models to detect and track hands in real-time video streams. This can be particularly useful for applications in gesture recognition, human-computer interaction, and augmented reality.

FEATURES:

- **Real-time Hand Detection**: Utilizes MediaPipe's hand tracking model to detect hands in video streams.
- **Hand Landmarks Visualization**: Displays 21 landmarks on each detected hand for detailed tracking.
- **Multiple Hands Support**: Capable of tracking multiple hands simultaneously.
- **Customizable**: Easy to modify and extend for applications like gesture recognition, sign language interpretation, or gaming.

REQUIREMENTS:

To run this project, you need:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe
```

USUAGE:

1. Clone the repository or download the code files.
2. Run the script using Python.
3. Allow access to your camera when prompted.
4. The application will open a window showing the detected hands and their landmarks.
