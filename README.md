# Volume-Hand-Tracking


This project demonstrates hand tracking capabilities using OpenCV and MediaPipe in Python. It leverages MediaPipe's powerful machine learning models to detect and track hands in real-time video streams. This can be particularly useful for applications in gesture recognition, human-computer interaction, and augmented reality.

FEATURES:

- Real-time Hand Detection: Utilizes MediaPipe's hand tracking model to detect hands in video streams.
- Hand Landmarks Visualization: Displays 21 landmarks on each detected hand for detailed tracking.
- Multiple Hands Support: Capable of tracking multiple hands simultaneously.
- Customizable: Easy to modify and extend for other applications like gesture recognition, sign language interpretation, or gaming.

REQUIREMENTS:

To run this project, you need:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe
